```{r}
library(prob)
library(gtools)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
titanic = read_csv(here("titanic.csv"))
titanic %>%
  mutate(crew = if_else(class %in% c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"), FALSE, TRUE)) -> titanic

titan_crew = filter(titanic, crew == TRUE)
titan_civilian = filter(titanic, crew == FALSE)
```

```{r}
crew_surv_prob = nrow(filter(titan_crew, survived == "yes"))/nrow(titan_crew)
crew_surv_prob
civ_surv_prob = nrow(filter(titan_civilian, survived == "yes"))/nrow(titan_civilian)
civ_surv_prob
```
civilians as a whole group had a higher probability of survival than crew
this does not take into account different classes of civilans or crew
it stands to reason the survival probabilities for different classes and different jobs will have been significantly different.

```{r}
# Q1
5/6

# Q2
nrow(rolldie(3))

# Q3
Q3 = mutate(rolldie(4), total_5_6_7 = X1+X2+X3+X4)
total_outcomes = nrow(Q3)
Q3F = filter(Q3, total_5_6_7 %in% c(5,6,7))
filtered_outcomes = nrow(Q3F)
Q3_prob = filtered_outcomes/total_outcomes
# part 1
total_outcomes
# part 2
Q3_prob
# part 3
# we assume that the the order of dice count as a different event even if the numbers are the same and functionaly identical

# Q4
2/nrow(permutations(5,5))
# the only possible correct states are ascending and descending.
# however a programatic method could be deployed by running the sort() function and checking to see if the resulting vector matches the row.
# due to time and patience, im going to just plug the 2 in
