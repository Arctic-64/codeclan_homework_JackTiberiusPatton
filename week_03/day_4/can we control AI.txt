3 classes of AI:
weak, narrow ANI (we have)
strong, general AGI (we are working on)
strong, super ASI (an inevitable step from AGI)

strong AI is considered mankinds last invention

once AI achives a level of understanding surpassing the limit of human reckoning
how can we ever hope to control it

humans will become irrelevant

the only way to control AI is to cripple it

if artifical superintelligence is allowed to incept, 
it could be the greatest achivemnt of mankind.
it could also be the most destructive thing we have ever done.
the only certain thing is that we will not control it.
an indirect quote from elon musk

would it be moral to control a being of such capability on the gorunds its composed of silicon?

an AI neural net matrix is a black box for all intensive purposes
and like a human brain, its too complex to understand even if the basic concept is grasped.

the more crutches you have them ore it hurts when their kicked out from under you

no system can be completely isolated and remain usefull
any exploit is a total exploit

no such thing as a foolproof containment method.
anything you think of would also be thought of by the AI
