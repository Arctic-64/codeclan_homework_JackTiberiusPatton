dependant on the reliability of the data.
probably more likely to overfit as certain schools, postcodes and wealthy families tend to do better
however this is a corrolation and not a causal relationship.

use 33,559 as a lower score fits better (assumeing test data)

use the first one, ajusted R^2 is higher

underfitting, the test and train scores are very simmilar and quite high.

k fold validation works by splitting the data into equal chunks
then useing all data as testing and training with one test set per fold.
the number of folds is the number of chunks

a validation set is sometimes used interchangably with a test set.
however a validation set is used in training to gauge a programs status.
this cannot be considered a true test set 
the vlaidation data (although partial) is being used to influence the modee

backward selection works by starting a model with all avaiable parameters
then systematicaly removeing the ones with least statistical significance

best subset can be considered a brute force method for finding the best model
all possible combinations for each number of patameters are calculated.
the best combinations for each number are selected
and from theis pool, the best overall model is selected.
